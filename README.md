# Credit
Credit is a program that is created for CS50 Problem Set 1. The program is created by using C. The users will be prompted to enter a credit card number in integers. After that, the program will be classified whether the credit card number is AMEX (American Express), MASTERCARD, VISA, or INVALID. The validity of the Visa card is checked by using Luhn's Algorithm.
